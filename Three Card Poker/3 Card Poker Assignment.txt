The object of the game is to make the best poker hand possible with only
three cards. To start, the player places an ante wager (5$) and/or a
pair plus wager, betting that they will have a hand of at least a pair
or better. 

Three cards are then dealt face down to each player and to the dealer. 

You are only playing the dealer and are not playing the other players at
the table. The player will then look at their hand and determine whether
to place a play wager (equal to the amount they put as the ante wager)
to pit their hand against the dealer’s hand or not. 

If a player folds, the hand is over and the dealer will collect the
player's ante wager and pair plus wager. 

If the player places a play wager, the cards will be turned over to
determine if the player has a better hand than the dealer.

If the dealer has a hand of Jack-high or worse, the play wager is
returned to the player.

If the dealer has a hand of Queen-high or better, both the play wager
and the ante are paid out at 1 to 1 if the player has a better hand than
the dealer. 

If the dealer’s hand is superior, both the ante and play bets are
collected. 

The pair plus bet is determined completely independent to what the
dealer has.
